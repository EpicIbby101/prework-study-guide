# Prework Study Guide

## Description

I wanted to create a simple webpage where I can have a list of things I've learned during the bootcamp for easy revision.
I built this project to help not just myself but others revise on our study topics.
This project is a culmination of everything I've learned from the bootcamp so far in terms of laying down the HTML of the webpage, the styling through CSS and applying logic with JavaScript.

## Usage

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
